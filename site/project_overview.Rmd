# Introduction


## Previous studies

Many studies attempted to produce land-use/land-cover (LuLc) maps for Jambi province. Nevertheless, these maps do not meet project demands for different reasons:

- do not cover entire province 
- classes are delineated visually with coarse resolution
- are outdated

e.g. [@Ekadinata2011; @Melati2017; @Nurwanda2016; @SooChinLiew2003]

-----------------

## Objectives of this study

In order to serve as reference for further research questions in the project, a number of demands have been defined. 
The produced map should:

- cover the entire province
- be up-to-date (ideally 2018/19)
- have similar classes to other classifications to make it comparable
- have a focus on oil palm plantations
- have a reasonable accuracy

Ideally a similar map with same classes can be produced for past years to:

- enable change analysis
- detect hotspots of forest conversion
- make predictions for future development


-----------------

# Methods

The classification process is done with Google Earth Engine (GEE) and R. While the reference data was delineated in GEE, images from Bing Maps and Google Earth Pro were also used for visual interpretation of lulc-classes. As model tuning is not possible in GEE the reference data was exported to R in order to find the best model parameters. The classification itself was then done in GEE, using model parameters defined in R.

## Reference Data

### LuLc-Classes in previous studies

Previous studies on land-use and land-cover in Jambi used a variety of classification keys. Some classes were classified as sub-categories in other studies, while other classes were merged or were not assessed at all.  
@Melati2017 used different classification schemes for different purposes (areas) by merging the 22 classes differentiated by the Ministry of Forestry. @Stolle2003 also used many classes (14), while @Sambodo2018, @Nurwanda2016, and @Ekadinata2011 merged some of the classes into broarder categories. 

```{r read_classes, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap = "LuLc-classes used by studies in Jambi province"}
classes <- read_csv(here("raw_data/classification-classes.csv"), na = "NA")
dt_classes <- classes 

names(dt_classes)[1] <- paste0(names(dt_classes)[1], 
                                footnote_marker_symbol(1))

-----------------

### LuLc-Classes in this study {.tabset .tabset-pills}

As @Melati2017 suggests oil palm plantations were differentiated in mature and immature plantations.
Class Rubber was not classified seperately since other studies had no success trying this (e.g. @Melati2017) and because rubber trees could not be differentiated visually in high resolution imagery for reference data creation.

### Data collection

#### Areas for reference data collection 

Reference data is delineated in GEE with support of high resolution imagery from GE Pro and Bing Maps. The following conditions were met for data collection:

- medium to large sized polygons   
*(more efficient but also less distributed with higher intracorrelation)*  
- cover only one LuLc-class  
*(avoid mixed pixels and false references)*
- based on high quality images from 2018/19  
*(up-to-date mapping)*
- have a low chance of further LuLc-changes recently  
*(avoid false references from changed classes)*
- distributed in the entire province  
*(cover regional variability)*


```{r figs, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "sample of reference data collected in GEE"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/wiesehahn/crc990_b05/blob/master/output_data/img/presentation/reference_banner.jpg?raw=true")
```
[see in GEE](https://code.earthengine.google.com/5a3241a7c5d90f1670bf1b3c910ca701)

#### Actual reference data selection

To generate the actual reference data a stratified sample of 1500 randomly distributed reference pixels per class was extracted from these polygons. In total 12000 reference samples are generated, which are then devided in training and validation data.

-----------------

## Classification

A supervised classification algorithm with good performance should be used in combination with informative predictor variables.

**input variables**

A combination of *Sentinel-1* (radar) and *Sentinel-2* (optical) imagery is used, from which a reduced number of bands and indices is needed as predictor variables. Since GEE does not provide the ability of model tuning these steps are done in R.

**classification model**

Decision tree models are used widely for classification problems, preliminary tests indicated that *Random Forest* (RF) algorithm performed better than *Classification And Regression Trees* (CART). Hence, a RF model was trained to classify Land-use and Land-cover. 

**classification key**

see previous section on [LuLc-Classes in this study]

-----------------

### Model Tuning

A number of model parameters can be changed to achieve different results. Model tuning changes these parameters to get optimal results. Overfitting might be a problem. Parameters to be changed in all classifiers are input variables (bands and indices in our case) and training data. 
The random forest classifier implemented in GEE uses following parameters which can be tuned:  

- numberOfTrees (Integer, default: 1):
The number of Rifle decision trees to create per class.

- variablesPerSplit (Integer, default: 0):
The number of variables per split. If set to 0 (default), defaults to the square root of the number of variables.

- minLeafPopulation (Integer, default: 1):
The minimum size of a terminal node.

- bagFraction (Float, default: 0.5):
The fraction of input to bag per tree.


#### Gridsearch Results

Since model tuning is not implemented in GEE the reference data was imported in R and a gridsearch approach was applied to calculate performance metrics for different combinations of input parameters.  
The *number of trees* was held constant at a value of 500 because generally it is assumed that more trees give better performance. On the other side larger numbers also mean more processing time and chances to produce time-outs on the GEE server increase.  
Parameters for which a gridsearch was done are the *number of variables per split* (called mtry in R) and the *minimum terminal node size*.

                                 class = col_factor(levels = c("0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "10", "11", "12")),

```


```{r gridsearch}
# create random forest model
filename = here("output_data/model/rf_fit.rds")
if (file.exists(filename)){
  
  rf_fit <- readRDS(filename)
  
} else{
  
  # specify that the resampling method is 
  fit_control <- trainControl(## 10-fold CV
    method = "cv",
    number = 10)
  
  # define a grid of parameter options to try

  library(doParallel)
  cl <- makePSOCKcluster(4)

  # fit the model with the parameter grid
  rf_fit <- train(class ~ ., 
                  data = training, 
                  method = "ranger",
                  importance = "impurity" ,
                  trControl = fit_control,
                  # provide a grid of parameters
                  tuneGrid = rf_grid)

}
```


```{r gridsearch_result, fig.cap = "R output of gridsearch result for number of variables per split and minimal node size"}
print(rf_fit)
```


```{r gridsearch_result2, fig.cap= "plotted gridsearch result for the number of predictor variables and minimal node size"}
# ggplot(data= rf_fit$results) + 
#   geom_line(aes(x=mtry, y=Accuracy, color= as.factor(min.node.size))) + 
#   geom_point(aes(x=mtry, y=Accuracy, color= as.factor(min.node.size)), size = 3) +
#   scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = "D", name="Minimal Node Size") +
#   labs(x = "Randomly Selected Predictors",
#        y = "Accuracy (Cross-Validation)") +
#     theme_classic() +
#   theme(legend.position="bottom") 

rf_fit$results %>%
  plot_ly(x= ~mtry) %>%
  add_trace(y = ~Accuracy, 
            type = "scatter",
            mode = 'lines+markers', 
            color= ~ as.factor(min.node.size), colors = viridis_pal(option = "D")(3),
            error_y = ~list(array = AccuracySD),
            text = ~paste("Accuracy: ", Accuracy, "<br>AccuracySD:", AccuracySD) 
            ) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title="Randomly Selected Predictors"),
         yaxis = list(title="Accuracy (Cross-Validation)")) 

```

As we can see the differences are not very pronounced. Hence, a simpler model results in similar performance. Based on these results we can simplify our model in terms of minimal node size and variables per split without deteriorating the results.

-----------------

#### Model Simplification

Here we search for the simplest model without deteriorating the performance (max 2% difference to best model).

```{r gridsearch_result3, fig.cap= "R output for simplified model"}
# get simplest model with similar accuracy
whichTwoPct <- tolerance(rf_fit$results, metric = "Accuracy", 
                         tol = 2, maximize = TRUE)  

rf_fit$results[whichTwoPct,]
```

The results indicat that in terms of prediction accuracy a model with least variables per split (2) and a minimal node size of 1 is sufficient enough.

-----------------


#### Model Validation

To have a closer look at the model performance the validation data is classified with the best model obtained by gridsearch. Its confusion matrix is calculated as a value of prediction accuracy.

<br>

**Error Matrix**
```{r gridsearch_validation, fig.cap = "Error matrix for gridseach optimzed and simplified rf-model"}
# validation
testing.pred <- predict(rf_fit, newdata = testing[1:19], probability= F)
cm<- confusionMatrix(data = testing.pred, reference = testing$class)

cm.df <- as.data.frame.matrix(cm$table)

cm.df %>%
  
  mutate_all(~ifelse(. > max(cm.df[1:12])*0.75,
                  cell_spec(., "html", color = "white", bold = T, background = "green"),
                  ifelse(. > 0,
                         cell_spec(., color = "white", bold = T, background = spec_color(., option = "A", direction= -1, begin = 0.3, scale_from = c(0,53))),
                         cell_spec(., "html", color = "grey")
                         )
                  )
             ) %>%
  
  mutate(class = cell_spec(c("water - 0","primary forest - 1","secondary forest - 2","mature oilpalm - 3", "immature oilpalm - 4","shrubland - 5","plantation forest - 6","burned / cleared - 7","urban buildings - 8","coconut plantation - 10","rice - 11","tea plantation - 12"), "html",bold = T)) %>%
  select(class, everything(.)) %>%
  kable("html", escape = F, rownames = T, align=c('r', rep('c', 12))) %>%
  kable_styling("hover", full_width = F)
```

<br>

**Respective Accuracy**
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
print(cm$overall[1:4])
```

-----------------


#### Variable Importance

As determined before, model parameters *minimal node size* and *variables per split* have limited influence on model performance. As a consequence it is likely that the choice of predictor variables is important for model performance.  

Input variables considered as predictor variables in this study comprise: 

*Sentinel-2*
- Bands: 'B2','B3','B4','B5','B6','B7','B8','B8A','B11','B12'
- Indices: 'NDVI','NDWI','NBRI','NDMI','SAVI'

*Sentinel-1*
- Bands: 'VV','VH'
- Indices: 'VV_VH','VV_variance','VH_variance'

In model fitting a relative variable importance is calculated to give an impression which predictor variables are valuable and which are less valuable for the prediction process. (However, correlation between variables is not taken into account)


```{r gridsearch_importance, fig.cap= "Relative predictor variable importance"}
# variable importance
imp <- varImp(rf_fit)

plot(imp)
```

As we can see the importance metric varies between predictor variables, suggesting that the choice of predictor variables very much influences our model. While more predictor variables might add information they are also complicating the model and might even introduce noise. Hence, a reduction of predictor variables can enhance our model.

-----------------


### Feature Selection

To further simplify the prediction model a *Recursive Feature Elimitaion* (rfe) is applied. This will eliminate worst performing predictor variables (chosen by importance) at each step and keep the best performing variables to end up in a reduced number of predictor variables which perfom best in model prediction.

```{r rfe, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# perform reverse feature selection with all variables
filename = here("output_data/model/rfProfile_all.rds")
if (file.exists(filename)){
  
  rfProfile <- readRDS(filename)
  
  } else{
    # normalize data
    training_recipe <- recipe(class ~ ., data = training) %>%
      step_center(all_predictors()) %>%
      step_scale(all_predictors()) %>%
      step_nzv(all_predictors()) 
    
    train_prepped <- 
      training_recipe %>% 
      prep(training) %>% 
      juice()
    
    # number of features to test
    subsets <- c(1:19)
    
    training_ctrl <- rfeControl(
      method = "repeatedcv",
      repeats = 5,
      functions = rfFuncs, 
      returnResamp = "all"
    )
    
    library(doParallel)
    cl <- makePSOCKcluster(4)
    registerDoParallel(cl)
    
    rfProfile <- rfe(x = train_prepped %>% dplyr::select(-class),
                     y = train_prepped$class,
                     sizes = subsets,
                     metric = "Accuracy",
                     rfeControl = training_ctrl)
    
    stopCluster(cl)
    
    # save model
    saveRDS(rfProfile, filename)
    
    }
```

-----------------

#### Number of Features

The best model in regards to predictor variables uses 18 out of 19 variables, all except for *VV_variance*. However, we can see that the model performs equally good with less predictor variables.
```{r rfe_result2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "model performance by number of features evaluated with Recursive Feature Elimitaion"}
#ggplot(rfProfile) + theme_classic()
plot_ly(rfProfile$resample, y = ~Accuracy, color = ~as.factor(Variables), colors= viridis_pal(option = "D")(19), type = "box")
 
```


**Chosen variables**

```{r rfe_result, echo=FALSE}
print(predictors(rfProfile)) # chosen predictors
```

-----------------

#### Model Simplification

To simplify the model without loosing prediction accuracy we search for a model with less predictor variables, which has the same accuracy as the best performing model (max 2 % difference in accuracy).

```{r rfe_result3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "R output for RFE-simplified model"}
# get simplest model with similar accuracy
whichTwoPct <- tolerance(rfProfile$results, metric = "Accuracy", 
                         tol = 2, maximize = TRUE)  
var_num <- rfProfile$results[whichTwoPct,"Variables"]
rfProfile$results[whichTwoPct,]

```

As a result we get a model using the following 8 prediction variables instead of all 18 variables, which has almost the same accuracy.

```{r rfe_result4}
selectedVars <- rfProfile$variables
bestVar <- rfProfile$control$functions$selectVar(selectedVars, var_num)
bestVar
```

-----------------

### Final Model

Using the results from previous analysis we train a model with best performing predictor variables and model-hyperparameters. 

The *predictor variables* are:

* VH
* B5
* VV:VH
* B11
* VV
* B12
* NBRI
* NDVI

The *hyperparameters* are:

* Number of variables to possibly split at in each node (mtry) = 2
* Minimal node size = 1
* Number of trees = 500 (this was not optimized, as more trees usually give better results but the maximum number is limited by computation power)

-----------------

#### Model Validation

Applying the final model to predict LuLc-classes for the validation data set, the error matrix looks like this:

**Respective Accuracy**
```{r rfe_result6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
print(cm$overall[1:4])
```

If we compare the accuracy calculated for this model with the accuracy calculated for the previous model (using all predictor variables) we can see that it dropped by more than the defined 2%. Why is this?

- One reason might be that we optimized the model parameters (*minimal node size* and *variables per split*) for a model using all predictor variables. To check this we should apply the gridsearch to our simplified model.

- Another reason might be that we calculated model performance based on cross-validated traing data in model tuning, while we used validation data for calculating the error matrices. Hence, using all predictor variables might result in overfitting on training data.

### Classification Reliability

The model validation provides us with values for overall model performance, but cannot provide regional performance values.
Therefore, a second classification was produced to inform about per pixel classification certainty. Since classification probability can only be calculated for a two-class classifier and the project focus is put on oilpalm plantations, the LuLc-classes in the training dataset were merged into following classes: 

1. **Oilpalm plantation (mature and immature)** 
2. **other classes**

A classifier was then trained on this data with its output mode set to probability.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Classification certainty for classes oil palm plantation and others"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/wiesehahn/crc990_b05/blob/master/output_data/img/presentation/certainty.jpg?raw=true")
```
[see in GEE](https://code.earthengine.google.com/ae39bc061d4b551c20720a432d7b02e9)

**dark purple** - high certainty for **other classes**

**yellow** - high certainty for **oilpalm plantation**

**pink/red** - low certainty for **any class**

# Results

Using the final model from previous steps we perform the classification itself in GEE.

# Problems 

## Classification

### reference data {.tabset .tabset-pills}

#### bad image quality {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/wiesehahn/crc990_b05/blob/master/output_data/img/reference/problems/ge_bad-scene.jpg?raw=true")
```
[see in Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@-1.358113,102.9531757,4277m/data=!3m1!1e3)

For a lot of areas in Jambi there is no appropriate reference image available. Problems, among others, are:  
- no high resolution imagery is available  
- high resolution imagery is covered by clouds  
- last appropriate image is severeal years old  


#### land-use mosaic 1 {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/wiesehahn/crc990_b05/blob/master/output_data/img/reference/problems/ge_mosaic1.jpg?raw=true")
```
[see in Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@-1.1448537,104.1225995,1069m/data=!3m1!1e3)

In many regions of Jambi province, the LuLc-pattern is very heterogenious with many different classes densely mixed. In these cases it is hard to collect reference data because areas covered by a single LuLc-class are very small and chances are high to receive backscatter of mixed classes.


#### land-use mosaic 2 {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/wiesehahn/crc990_b05/blob/master/output_data/img/reference/problems/ge_mosaic2.jpg?raw=true")
```
[see in Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@-1.7708193,101.2165027,881m/data=!3m1!1e3)

In some cases LuLc-classes are devided by other classes (e.g. intercropped with trees) which also makes it more difficult to collect proper reference data.


#### similar appearance {-}
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/wiesehahn/crc990_b05/blob/master/output_data/img/reference/problems/ge_plantation.jpg?raw=true")
```
[see in Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@-1.396042,102.7611715,935m/data=!3m1!1e3)

Some classes are hard to differentiate from each other even in high resolution aerial images. 
For example:  
- Primary forest / Secondary forest  
- Secondary forest / Plantation forest  
- Oil palm plantation / Coconut plantation  


### Processing

Although most processing steps were done in Google Earth Engine, using high performance server clusters via cloud computing, calculations were problematic. For the calculations vast amounts of data had to be processed. The area of interest (Jambi) is quite large covering many image tiles, for each tile data from almost 2 years was processed from different sources (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) in many steps. Due to these complex processing steps calculations were aborted (timed-out) from time to time and other calculations took several days to complete before results could be evaluated and following steps could be initiated.
