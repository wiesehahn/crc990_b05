### Objectives{-}

The objective of this study is to analyse recent land-use and land-cover (lulc) patterns in Jambi Province, Indonesia.  

Leading research questions are:  

* Is it possible to detect land-use and land-cover types with appropriate accuracy?  
* Is a combination of Sentinel platforms (1+2) useful?  
* Which area is covered by oil palm plantations?  
* How do these areas change and what are the hotspots?  
* Are there still some intact forest landscapes left?
