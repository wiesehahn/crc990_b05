#### Land use patterns in Jambi - quantification of structure, heterogeneity and changes of vegetation and land use as a basis for the explanation of ecological and socioeconomic functions{-}


-----------------

The objective of this study is to analyse recent land-use and land-cover (lulc) patterns in Jambi Province, Indonesia.  

Leading research questions are:  
- Is it possible to detect land-use and land-cover types with appropriate accuracy?  
- Is a combination of Sentinel platforms (1+2) useful?  
- Which area is covered by oil palm plantations?  
- How do these areas change and what are the hotspots?  
- Are there still some intact forest landscapes left?
