abstract = {Land cover has changed dramatically in Sumatra Island, Indonesia over the last decades. Rampant deforestation has drawn a lot of attention due to the potential global impact of the associated carbon stock loss on climate warming and the erosion of biodiversity. The various land uses which replace natural forest are not equally benign to the environment. Rubber agroforests (jungle rubber) are extensive traditional cropping systems. They have been singled out by previous studies as the best land use option for biodiversity conservation once forest is cleared, while allowing farmers to make a living from the deforested land. But how sustainable are complex agroforestry systems themselves? Are they not just a transient stage in the overall process of land use intensification? We studied land cover change in the Bungo district, in Jambi, Sumatra (Indonesia), a 4,550 km 2 area. Large forest tracks have been cleared since the early seventies and replaced by rubber plantations, oil palm plantations and other agricultural land-uses. Landsat images taken between 1973 and 2005 were used to quantify the trends of land cover changes in the area. during that period forest cover fell from more than 75{\%} to 30{\%}. Simultaneously monoculture plantations increased from 3{\%} to over 40{\%}, while rubber agroforests, decreased from 15{\%} to 11{\%}. Strikingly most of the rubber agroforests present in 2005 where absent in 1973 while most of the rubber agroforests present in 1973 had been replaced by more intensive agricultural systems by 2005. Rubber agroforests are now the ultimate reservoir of the original lowland forest biodiversity since natural forest has almost completely disappeared from the peneplain. They are however under growing pressure themselves and have incurred an accelerated conversion rate to more intensive agricultural systems in the period 2002–2005. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Multi-temporal satelite imagery and digital change detection technique help in understanding land use-cover change (LUCC). The record of land use-cover changes provide the direction and can be used as guidelines to identify issues, problems, and guidelines for landscape planning. This study was conducted in Batanghari, Jambi Province. The purposes of this study are to analyze the characteristics of pattern of land cover changes with long temporal scale (1988 - 2014), to analyze driving factors of land use changes, and to analyze land fragmentation. LUCC maps (1988, 1994, 2004, {\&} 2014) were derived from remote sensing satellite images using supervised classification method (maximum likelihood) in ERDAS 9.3 Software, to define driving factors used regression binary logistic analysis in IDRISI Selva Software. Largest patch index (LPI) was also used to assess the fragmentation or dominance of LUCC type. The results showed Logit Y= -0.14 – 0.0800 X1 – 0.07360 X2 + 0.02468 X3 + 0.44584 X4 – 0.02382 X5 + 0.02769 X6. The highest land fragmentation occur in Mersam, Marosebo Ulu, and Tembesi.},

abstract = {Jambi is one of the provinces in Indonesia with rainforests that support a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna. However, in the last two decades, Jambi Province has been experiencing rapid deforestation, expansion of monoculture plantation crops (especially palm oil and rubber), mining activities, and other types of natural resource exploitation. Various forms of anthropogenic disasters such as floods, peat subsidence, and forest fires have become more frequent in this region. Another serious problem is the conflict between different land use policies, especially governmental policies, land grabbing, and encroachment of forest and conservation areas. The objectives of this study are: (1) to overlay the existing land use maps over maps of the regional spatial plan, mining concession areas, and forest status, and (2) to analyze the land use and policy conflicts as well as their consequences. More than 2.2 million hectares (ha), or approximately 44.6{\%} of land in Jambi province, which is located outside the forest area, is abandoned or is unproductive. Approximately 96{\%} or more of the protected area (834,800 ha) is still maintained in accordance with its function. The space use conflicts mainly occur in the form of policy disagreements between the government institutions, namely between central government institutions of spatial planning, forestry, agriculture, as well as energy and mining. Furthermore, conflicts have also occurred because of the disagreement of local communities with the policies of the central government, local governments, and corporations (mostly mining and agricultural companies).},

abstract = {Numerous classification algorithms have been proposed to create accurate classification maps using optical remote sensing data. However, few comparative studies evaluate the performance of classification algorithms with focus on tropical forests due to cloud effects. Advances in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques and spatial resolution, mapping, and comparison of classification algorithms are possible. This research investigated the accuracy and processing speeds of five supervised classifiers, including Nai{\&}{\#}x0308;ve Bayes, AdaBoost, multi-layer perceptron, random forest (RF), and support vector machine, for land use-land cover (LULC) classification in a tropical region using time-series Advanced Land Observing Satellite-phased array type L-band SAR (ALOS-PALSAR) 25-m mosaic data. The study area is located in central Sumatra, Indonesia, where abundant forest-related carbon stocks exist. This investigation was intended to aid the implementation of a classification algorithm for the automatic creation of LULC classification maps. We perform object-based and pixel-based analyses to investigate the ability of the classifiers and their accuracies, respectively. RF had the best classification accuracy and processing speed in which the accuracies for 10 classes and 2 classes were 64.07{\%} and 90.22{\%} for pixel-based and 82.94{\%} and 86.23{\%} for object-based evaluations, respectively. These results indicate that RF is a useful classifier for the analysis of PALSAR mosaic data and that the automatic creation of highly accurate classification maps is possible by using time-series data. The outcome of this research will be valuable resources for biodiversity and global-warming mitigation efforts in the region.},

Atmospheric correction on the hyperspectral imagery was first performed using a commercial package. Principal component decomposition was then performed and an unsupervised ISODATA classification was carried out on the dominant components to produce a land cover classification map for each test site. Classification using the pixel unmixing method as implemented in the ENVI package was also performed. The results of classification were compared with existing land cover maps.},

@article{Stolle2003,
abstract = {In Indonesia, vegetation fires occur every year in the dry season. To determine where and why fires occur, the natural and cultural landscape features that influence the location of fires were analysed. We investigated the probability of fire occurrence as a function of predisposing conditions and ignition sources, such as land use, land use zoning, accessibility or land cover, to understand the spatial determinants of fires. The study area is the entire province of Jambi, central Sumatra, Indonesia. This province has a diverse setting of actors (small- and large-holders), land cover types and land uses. Fires were extracted for 1992/1993 from National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) satellite data. The results of the spatial statistical analysis show that fire occurrence in Jambi Province in 1992/1993 was determined both by predisposing conditions (mostly climate, elevation and suitability for specific tree crops) and human-related causes (presence of transmigration projects and land allocation to specific land uses). National policies are thus a major driving forces of fires through land allocation. Road accessibility is only an important determinant of fires in forests. Few fires seem to be accidental. While logging companies control fire during their exploitation of concessions, logged-over forests and forests allocated to production but not yet under use have many fires. In 1992/1993, large- and small-holders were likely to be both responsible for fire occurrence. These results highlight the large influence of land use and policies on vegetation fires in Indonesia. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
